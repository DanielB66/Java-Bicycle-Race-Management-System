# Java Bicycle Race Management System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a bicycle race management system using Java. It includes various classes to handle different types of bicycles and race-related entities, demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in Java.

## Features
- Manage different types of bicycles.
- Organize and manage bicycle races.
- Use of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation to create a flexible and scalable system.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for the bicycle race management system.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanielB66/Java-Bicycle-Race-Management-System
   ```
2. Compile the Java files.
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the `BicycleRace.java` script to see the application in action.
   ```sh
   java BicycleRace
   ```

## Classes
- **Bicycle.java:** Represents a generic bicycle.
- **BicycleRace.java:** Manages the race and contains methods to add and manage bicycles.
- **Box.java:** Utility class to manage bicycle accessories.
- **MountainBike.java:** Extends Bicycle to add features specific to mountain bikes.

## Object-Oriented Principles Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating data within classes and providing public methods to interact with that data.
- **Inheritance:** Creating a hierarchy of classes that inherit properties and methods from base classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Using method overriding and interfaces to allow objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface.
- **Abstraction:** Defining abstract classes and methods to provide a template for derived classes.
