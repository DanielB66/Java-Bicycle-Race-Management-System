🚴‍♂️ **New on GitHub: Java Bicycle Race Management System** 🚴‍♀️

I'm thrilled to share my latest project, the **Java Bicycle Race Management System**! This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java to manage bicycle races and related entities.

📊 **Project Name:** Java Bicycle Race Management System

🔍 **Project Description:**
In this project, I've developed a comprehensive system to manage bicycle races, including various types of bicycles and race-related entities. The system leverages OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create a robust and scalable solution.

🛠 **Technologies and Tools:**
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for this project.

📁 **Project Contents:**
- **Bicycle.java:** Represents a generic bicycle.
- **BicycleRace.java:** Manages the race and contains methods to add and manage bicycles.
- **Box.java:** Utility class to manage bicycle accessories.
- **MountainBike.java:** Extends Bicycle to add features specific to mountain bikes.
